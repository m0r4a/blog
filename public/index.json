I‚Äôm into coding (mostly Python, Go, and Bash, the SRE/Cloud stack), setting up powerful servers, and quirky projects like building custom keyboard layouts.\nI spend a lot of time in open-source communities, learning and sharing along the way. Here, you‚Äôll find a mix of my projects, tech stories (wins and losses) and maybe some class notes. I used to dump everything on GitHub, but decided it‚Äôs easier to organize it all here instead.\nNo big plans for fame or money, just sharing what I know and what I‚Äôm learning. Feel free to poke around!\n","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":" 1.

Its journey began in 1991, when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, embarked on creating a kernel based on Unix principles.\nKey Events in Linux History # August 25, 1991:\nLinus posted a now-famous message on the Usenet group comp.os.minix, stating:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won\u0026rsquo;t be big and professional like gnu)\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nOctober 1991:\nLinux version 0.02 was released, containing the basic core components that would eventually evolve into the modern Linux kernel.\nThe Role of the GNU Project # Linux combined with GNU (a project started by Richard Stallman to create a free Unix-like operating system) formed the basis of what is now called GNU/Linux. The GNU tools, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Bash shell, were integral to the success of Linux.\nLinux Today # Today, Linux is everywhere:\nServers\nLinux powers over 90% of the servers that run the internet.\nCloud Computing\nLinux is at the heart of major cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.\nEmbedded Systems\nLinux is used in devices ranging from smartphones to IoT gadgets.\nDid You Know? # The Linux mascot, a penguin named Tux, was chosen by Torvalds after he was once bitten by a penguin at a zoo. üêß\nLinux Kernel Version Table # Version Release Date Key Features 1.0 March 1994 First stable release of the kernel. 2.4 January 2001 Added support for USB, IPv6, and more. 3.0 July 2011 Improved scalability and ARM support. 4.0 April 2015 Introduced live patching capabilities. 5.0 March 2019 Better hardware support, energy efficiency improvements. Conclusion # From its humble beginnings as a hobby project, Linux has grown into a global phenomenon. Thanks to the power of open-source collaboration, it has become the backbone of modern computing, shaping the internet, cloud services, and even smart devices.\nLearn More About Linux\n","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/linux_history/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is a test post","title":"The History of Linux","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
