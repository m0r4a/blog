## Introduction

In a world where technology is advancing at breakneck speed, the demand for storage space has never been higher. Games are becoming more immersive and require substantial space, movies in 4K and 8K resolution are massive, and high-resolution audio files can take up gigabytes with ease. With so much digital content at our fingertips, it’s essential to ensure that storage needs are not just met but exceeded. Sometimes, even 80TB in RAID 10 isn’t enough to keep up with the ever-growing demands of modern life, where every file, project, and memory deserves a secure place to reside.

The question then arises, does Max really need more storage?
