## What's Linux?

Linux is an **open-source** operating system that dates back to the early 1990s. Its journey began in 1991, when *Linus Torvalds*, a Finnish computer science student, embarked on creating a kernel based on Unix principles.

## Key Events in Linux History

- **August 25, 1991**:  
  Linus posted a now-famous message on the Usenet group `comp.os.minix`, stating:

  > "I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)..."

- **October 1991**:  
  Linux version **0.02** was released, containing the basic core components that would eventually evolve into the modern Linux kernel.

### The Role of the GNU Project

Linux combined with **GNU** (a project started by Richard Stallman to create a free Unix-like operating system) formed the basis of what is now called **GNU/Linux**. The **GNU** tools, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Bash shell, were integral to the success of Linux.

## Linux Today

Today, Linux is everywhere:

1. **Servers**  
   Linux powers over **90%** of the servers that run the internet.

2. **Cloud Computing**  
   Linux is at the heart of major cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure**.

3. **Embedded Systems**  
   Linux is used in devices ranging from **smartphones** to **IoT** gadgets.
