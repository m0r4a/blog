decription: My tech blog: documenting battles with new tools, sharing discoveries, and trying not to drown in the vast sea of technology.

Hey, welcome to my corner of the internet! I love experimenting with new stuff. One minute, I’m checking out an app, and the next, it’s 3 AM and I’m deep into Linux kernel docs. I’m into coding (mostly Python, Go, and Bash, the SRE/Cloud stack), setting up powerful servers, and quirky projects like building custom keyboard layouts.

I spend a lot of time in open-source communities, learning and sharing along the way. Here, you’ll find a mix of my projects, tech stories (wins and losses) and maybe some class notes. I used to dump everything on GitHub, but decided it’s easier to organize it all here instead.

No big plans for fame or money, just sharing what I know and what I’m learning. Feel free to poke around!
